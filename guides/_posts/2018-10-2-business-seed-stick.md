So we had our first event at interactive nature (check out our website if you haven't already [interactivenature.art](https://interactivenature.art "Interactive Nature Homepage")) and we needed a way to get our name out to attendees and considering the fact that I find business cards repulsive and a utter waste of reasources I though I would do something a little more "conscious" and thus was born business seed sticks! Plant em, gift em, heck even rebrand em just don't let it sit in your wallet or drawer for years until you trash it.

For this project you will need the folowing tools:
* Paint brush
* Stove and sauce pan
* Laser Cutter or custom stamp (optional)

## Steps
![Steps](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/seedstick/steps.jpg)
1. Laser cut your materials. 
* If you went with balsa wood try to get a piece that is about as thick as a popsicle stick. 
* If you do not have access to a laser cutter try getting a custom stamp ordered online just make sure it fits on your popsicle stick!
2. Mix up some paste.
* Boil 3 tablespoons of white vinegar in a small saucepan (I had to tilt mine on the stove because I didn't have a small one).
* While mixing add 1 packet unflavored gelatin.
* While mixing add 1 teaspoon of sugar.
* While mixing add 1 teaspoon mint or vanilla extract (this acts as a preservative).
* Pour into small container.
* Keep in the fridge and thaw in a hot water bath when needed!
3. Using a paint brush paint a thin layer of your glue onto your stick.
* Add the seed. 
* Using your paint brush, drip a glob (large enough to cover and engulf the seed) of glue over the seed.
4. Let dry.
