title: Tetra Pak Tea Lights

So I am on a tetra pak kick right now. I really like the triangular shape that I made doing the tetra pak sculpture, but I thought I would change things up a bit and string them together. The result s a tetra pak tea light holder. Hang one or hang 7! Just be careful I am not sure how well the waxed paper holds up with a tea light in it long term...

* Box cutter or scissors
* Marker 
* Ruler
* Awl
* Needle nose pliers (optional but useful)
* Side cutters (optional but useful) 

## Steps
![Steps](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/tealight/steps.png)
1. Make the tea light holder (refer to the tetra pak sculpture post for more detailed steps)
* Cut down the edge of your containers.
* Cut each side to look like a triangle.
* Punch a small hole in the tops of the triangle you just cut out.
* Join the tops of the triangle together with wire.
* Repeat for how ever many tetra pak's you have.
2. Cut a strip of tetra pak.
* I like to use the double layered bit on the edge of one of the pieces you cut out in step 1.
* It is easiest to keep the point bit on the end so you can thread the piece better in step 4.
* Poke a small hole at the ends of each strip.
3. Poke two holes in the bottom of your tetra pak traingle shape.
* Use the awl to poke two adjacent holes.
* Use the boxx cutter to make your holes wide enough for step 4.
* Repeat for however many tetra paks you have.
4. Thread the strip through the base or top of your tetra pak.
* If you only have one tetra pak or this is the last in your chain thread it through the top part of the shape you made.
* If you have more then one thread it through the base.
5. Tie together the strip of tetra pak with a piece of wire.
* Make sure to loop it through the top of your next shape.
6. Enjoy your new tealight holder!

Ain't she a beaut! I am really loving this shape. I imagine it would be pretty cool to attach the bases half way through and string the things horizontally. Perhaps I will when I get more. I also want to do another sculpture with more face, but first I gotta turn the other sculpture into a lamp! Get pumped for more tetra pak madness!
