Last month we made a pretty groovy tetra pak hanging planter from the tops of milk cartons! Today we are going to see what we can make with the bottoms of the tetra paks!

## Materials

For this project you will need the folowing materials:
* Six tetra pak milk cartons
* Wire ties (I get mine from kale bundles!)
* A piece of string

## Tools

For this project you will need the folowing tools:
* Xacto knife or scissors 
* Marker 
* Ruler
* Hole punch or awl (optional but really useful)
* Needle nose pliers (optional but useful)
* Side cutters (optional but useful)

## Steps
![Steps](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/post2/steps.png)
1. Cut down the edge of your containers.
* Use the exacto knife or scissors your finished project should look like the first picture.
2. Cut each side to look like a triangle.
* Use a ruler or tape measure to measure the mid point of each side (you can also eyeball it if you please). 
* Use the straight edge to draw a line from the mid point to the corresponding corner of the tetra paks base.
* Make sure to four  holes in each of the corners of the base of the tetra pak **not pictured!**. 
* Punch a small hole in the tops of the triangle you just cut out.
3. Join the tops of the triangle together with wire.
* I chose to remove the wire I had from the paper/plastic sheathing using some pliers for a cleaner end product.
* Use two loops, join two adjacent sides with a loop and bring the third side to meet the joined sides, wrap the excess wire into the hole of the third side to join it to the other two sides. Repeat for the fourth side. Two sides should be joined with two loops of wire running through them joining the other two sides with the excess bits.
4. Reat steps 1-3 for all six containers
5. When you have all six pyramids buildt begin joining the sides by looping wire through the holes you punched in the base. Twist the excess wire together and snip off the ends with side cutters for a clean finish.
6. Tie a piece of string to the top of one pyramid and find a good place to hang your new tetra pak scultpture!

There you have it your very own tetra pak sculpture! Stay tuned to see what we can do with those triangle shape scrap tetra pak pieces. As well as how the design can be modified to be an outdoor solar powered hanging light fixture!
