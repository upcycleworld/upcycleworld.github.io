title: Tetra Pak Tea Lights
category: blog
---

So I am on a tetra pak kick right now. I really like the triangular shape that I made doing the tetra pak sculpture, but I thought I would change things up a bit and string them together. The result a tetra pak tea light holder. Hang one or hang 7! Just be careful I am not sure how well the waxed paper holds up with a tea light in it long term.
