# Interactive vine dome 
![dome'n!](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/dome/Dome.jpg)

The flower dome is an ongrowing project that uses capacitive touch sensors (MPR121) and arduino to change lights (WS2812b LED strips) in the dome when the copper tape [sensors are touched](https://youtu.be/OWx7huYEl34). The dome was built from panels designed my an A&M professor and rescued from the trash.  Surrounding the dome are wild flowers.

The flower dome began as a vine dome but the vines were taken out by winter freezes :(
