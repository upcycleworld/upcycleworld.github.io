# DJ BUGN OUT

![Cover image](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/dj/cover.png)

DJ Bugn Out was a project I completed in the fall of 2014. I wrote a program in matlab that tracked multiple objects (mechanical bugs in a controlled environment) using kalman filtering and the Hungarian method. The position data was then sent to Ableton Live as midi data and mapped to different effects parameters and instruments. [Check out a video of the code in action!](https://youtu.be/j4_XVTVPZ5A)
