# Chicken Coop theatre
![The Cast](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/cct/group.JPG)

The Chicken Coop Theatre is a theatre I built in my back yard. Along with my roomates and friends I have put on one show, though we have more planned for the future!

The stage, lighting, sets, and costumes are made from all recycled materials.

The first show at the Chicken Coop Theatre was an adult adaptation of a popular kids show.

An audience of over 60 people came out to watch the show!
