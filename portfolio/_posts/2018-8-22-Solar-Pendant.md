The solar light pendant is a prototype I developed using 3d printing and the innards of a solar garden light. I designed and printed a case for the solar panel and garden lights electronics (a boost converter circuit and AAA NiCad battery) to repurpose the $1 light as a wearable. The wearable acts as a sort of sunlight meter and lights up at night for however long you spent in the sun during the day.
