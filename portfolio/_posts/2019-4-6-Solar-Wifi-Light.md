# WiFi Enable Solar Garden Light
The WiFi enabled solar light proejct is currently a work in progress. A proof of concept video can be found [here!](https://youtu.be/LMvoPBrb3eQ)

Currently the hardware is completed for one light to run 3 hours. However I am still working on getting the battery that is running the WiFi board to recharge using the solar panel.
