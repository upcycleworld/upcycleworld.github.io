title: Laser Cutting Live Plants
category: work
---
Okay so I am working on some crazy shit right now. I got it in my head to laser cut some live plants. I am really just bored of the vines, just kidding I could never get bored of plants, but seriously, I can't find anyone else who has been crazy enough to try it so I am giving it a go, for science.

#Pre trial
So I laser cut a leaf first. I am working with pothos vines, because they are like super hard to kill so I figured they would probably be able to take a 10.6 um IR 30W laser right!?

Pretty cool eh?

#Trial 1
The leaf trial looked pretty cool so I decided to give it a go with the living vine. I used raster settings 90s 40p 600dpi as the book said that was good for engraving plants (just kidding but it did say that it was good for leather so I figured yea Ill try it. I taped the leaves to a piece of cardboard so they would be flat.

It was around 6pm on Friday and I was anxious to get home so I didn't bother lining up the laser cutter perfectly (our machine is really hard to align/ I am new to it so I haven't quite figured it out) as well the last leaf wasn't taped down perfectly so the beam cut it somewhat out of focus, but I later found out this played to my advantage.

#The Aftermath
I immediately transfered the vine back to the upcycled wine bottle vase I had kidnapped it from and booked it out of the office. When I got home I noticed the vine looked pretty sad, but the third leaf only looked somewhat upset.

Next week I am gonna give it a go with a lower power. I should have realized less is obviously more with this sort of thing, but its a lesson I learned so your plant won't have to. Hoping the little guy stays with it!
