# Light Table
![Light Table](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/light_table/table.jpg)

The light table is a table I made out of a broken table I found on the street. The plexiglass was repurposed from broken frames and mounted in the table using plastic braces made from coconut bottles. Inside the table is a (kind of) to scale model of my back yard made from trash and 3d printed objects. The table has 120 LED's controlled by a generic ESP8266 model and custom PCB. You can check out a video of the table in action [here](https://youtu.be/YaXWLLOUznQ)

The custom build PCB board regulates power to the ESP8266 and allows for easy programming!
