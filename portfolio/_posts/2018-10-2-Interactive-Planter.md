# Interactive Planter
![Group Photo!](https://upcycleworld.github.io/images/interactiveplanter/group.jpg)

The interactive planter was a project I completed with the interactive nature art collective I am a part of. I was in charge of electronics design and collaborated with writing the [capacitive touch code](https://github.com/mikebru/PlantLamps). The project culminated in a live showing of the planters at the Umlauf sculpture garden for the emerging artist fair.
