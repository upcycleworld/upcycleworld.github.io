Tetra Pak's are the waxed containers that half gallons of milk usually come in. Where I live they do not accept them for recycling which is fine because they are way more fun to upcycle! In this guide I will show you how to turn those tetra paks into a tetra planter! 

## Materials

For this project you will need:
* 5x washed out and mostly liquid free tetra paks
* At least one cap from your tetra paks
* 8x wire ties (I get mine from kale bundles)
* t-shirt hemming (and scrap fabric or rope will do)

## Tools

* box cutter (optional)
* hole punch (optional)

1. Cut off the tops of your tetra paks make them as staight and as flush as possible. 
* I recommend cutting the shorter end first and then working your way around the perimeter.
* Start the cut around 1/4" in from the edge. 
* If you are not using a box cutter stab your scissors (carefully!) in the middle of your cut line to begin.
* I like to work on the plastic lid of a spinach container to contain any liquid that may have been left in the tetra pak.
2. Lay out a net.
* This step is important to plan your planter! 
* Make sure you keep atleast two of the drink holes from opposite sides facing up.
3. Mark and punch your holes.
* Punch your holes in one side and then line up the adjacent piece and mark the spots where the holes line up. 
* I do around 3 per side.
4. Join your sides with wire. 
* Cut your wire into 3 pieces around 3-4" in length.
* Thread them through so that equal amounts of wire stick out.
* Twist!
* Start with the base and two adjacent sides.
5. Tie on your t-shirt ropes.
6. Enjoy your upcycled hanging planter!

There you have it your very own tetra planter. Stay tuned next week to see what we will do with those left over tetra pak pieces.
