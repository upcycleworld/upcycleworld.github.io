  <p>Upcycling as opposed to recycling is to reuse refuse (or perhaps rather refuse refuse) in such a way as to create a product of higher value then the original. This site seeks to spread knowledge through detailed guides and instructional materials, ultimately my goal is for others to make, improve, and share whatever I post here, with the only caveat being they do so soley with discarded objects! In some ways this site is my blog, in other ways it is portfolio, in all ways this site is devoted to spreading knowledge and helping others take steps to limit their impact and begin healing our earth together!
